# DNNVarFix-Automatic-Repair-and-Type-binding-of-undeclared-variables-using-Neural-Networks
Deep learning had been used in program analysis for the prediction of hidden software defects using software defect datasets, security vulnerabilities using generative adversarial networks as well as identifying syntax errors by learning a trained neural machine translation on program codes. However, all these approaches either require error reports or bug-free source codes that are executable for training the deep learning model. Our neural network model is neither trained with any defect datasets nor bug-free code samples, instead it is trained using structural semantic details of ASTs where each node represents a construct appearing in the source code. This model is implemented to fix one of the most common semantic errors, such as undeclared variable errors as well as infer their type information before program compilation. By this approach, the model has achieved in fixing 81$\%$ of the programs on prutor dataset of 1058 programs with undeclared variable errors and inferring the right data types in 80$\%$ of the programs outperforming the previous approaches that had learned using bug-free code examples.
